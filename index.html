  <meta name="About Anya Parker" content="Anya Parker is a community organizer, salon owner, executive director of  Women of Brown, and a friend to children. She is no stranger to leadership and organizing communities.  The person who influences Anya the most is her grandmother. Anya was blessed to be raised by Sarah H Johnson, the first African American city council woman in Greenville, Ms. Having such a powerful force in Anya’s life affirmed why it is important to be a leader of color. It is important to blaze trails, but equally as important to remember from whence we came from and those who laid groundwork before us.">
  <meta name="Anya Parker 2020" content=" Our Mission is to mobilize community members and transform them into progressive leaders. We are no longer waiting on change, but demanding it. Our children deserve access to equitable education, and a neighborhood free of crime, and access to a livable wage">

Anya Parker is a proud graduate of Northside High School in Memphis, TN. The high school is closed now due to low student enrollment. Anya still holds this learning institution very near and dear to her heart. The school had an onsite childcare, auto mechanic, carpentry, beauty & barbering programs. Anya is a strong believer in providing children with access to quality education. Children not only need access to a good education but they need programs and resources to help prepare them for their adult world. Anya wants to bring CTE programs into the schools to prepare our youth for the workforce and those skills needed to become their own boss.

Anya uses her talents and gifts to bless others. As a hairstylist, she listens to her client’s complaints about the community where they live. Anya felt that she had to do something to help the community. As a way of helping she hosted homeless drives, toy drives, workshops and events to bring about awareness for those less fortunate. Anya produced a hair show for St.Jude Children’s Research Hospital three years in a row to help raise money for children in need.</p>

Anya always knew that one day she would have to step up as a leader. She got fired up when a piece of legislation came across her desk that would have dismantled 55,000 beauty professionals' careers.
Anya has always been an advocate for community members. It was natural for her to jump right in and galvanize beauty professionals to fight deregulation. Because of her efforts this piece of legislation was stopped. Anya believes that there should be regulations in place for businesses to protect customers and business owners from harm.</p>

                <p>Did you know that quality healthcare could not only be accessible but affordable? So why has it taken so long for the legislation to pass a bill that would ensure quality healthcare for everyone?
Did you also know that the pharmaceutical industry is big business? Have you looked at the price of some of the medications you are taking? It’s ridiculous. In order for everyone to receive quality healthcare, we have to give everyone a chance to utilize their healthcare benefits in a different way.</p>
                  
                  <p>Our medical plan will allow doctors to charge their patients on a sliding scale rather than having everyone pay across the board. This would ensure that the patient could still remain or find a doctor for quality care instead of the state funded and ran networks that are currently in place. Did you know that paying bills that you cannot afford increases tension and blood pressure? Changing the way healthcare is provided and the cost associated with it would alleviate many of the concerns that patients have regarding their medical, dental and eye insurance plans. Let’s give doctor's reins to provide quality healthcare on a scaling rate pending the patient’s annual income. Paying more for higher salaried patients ensures that the cost of quality care for low income patients will provide wellness for everyone connected by way of work, school, public parks, restaurants, etc. Everyone would receive the same quality of care without compromising society with illness or epidemics due to the high cost of quality care. Making healthcare accessible to everyone. Quality of care is a major concern. Quality care should be how we care for Tennesseans period. </p>

Education is the fabric that holds our communities together. If children are educated properly it will have long lasting effects of job increase and lowering the crime rate. All students deserve access to an equitable education and the ability of school choice. 
</p>
                  <p>The latest and most controversial legislation around education in Tennessee has been school vouchers. School voucher programs give parents funds from the public education system to put towards putting children in private schools. Which sounds like a great idea. The problem is the vouchers will only be available to people who are below the poverty line and receive TANF. One area of the voucher program is the Education Savings Account it needs to have more framework before it is issued out to students. If a student withdraws the remaining funds are returned to the state treasurer and placed into a BEP account (Basic Education Program) educational trust fund of 1992.</p>
                  
                  <p>Our government has failed to lay out an education plan that is fair and allows all students to play on the same field. Under investment in teachers, students, and schools have allowed other countries to pass us by. The education plan should reflect the community that it serves. Our Kid’s First Education Plan will bridge the inequality gap of education and streamline resources.</p>

                <p>It’s no secret. The crime rate in Memphis is high. How do we combat crime? What has happened in the past and what is going on now is not working. We need to give those that commit these crimes an opportunity to restore themselves as productive citizens in society. We need to create an offset to the cycle after you have committed a crime.</p>
                  
                  <p>Once an inmate has served time they should be able to get back to work into society. But it is hard for ex-offender to re enter society because employers are afraid to hire them. Employers fear that they will reoffend. The issue with this is, if we don’t create policies to get exoffender’s reaclamated they likeness of them reoffending may occur.</p>
                  
                  <p>Giving prisoners a training program that will work for them after they have left prison is vital. Restorative Justice could be that plan. With everyone involved to provide a productive program that would educate the offender and holding him/her accountable while members of society are provided the opportunity to monitor the progress of the offender. By evaluating the work and consistency of the offender in the program. </p>

                <p>Tennessee has not raised the minimum wage since 2009. The hourly minimum wage is $7.25. If you multiply that times 40 hours you will make $290 a week and $15,080 annually. In Tennessee, a minimum wage worker will need to work at least 69 hours a week to afford a one bedroom home without spending 30% of their income. We have a plan to increase the state minimum wage for the workers to survive today’s expense. Increasing the minimum wage not only helps working people, but it stimulates the economy.”</p>
                  <p>Tennessee is one of five states that does not have a state minimum wage law. When a state does not have a state minimum wage law the federal rule applies. Tennesees does not have a law for overtime, so federal overtime rules apply. In order to protect citizens from crime, poverty, and lack of resources we must raise the minimum wage to a livable wage of $10.10. Raising our state wage is our first priority. The unemployment rate is low, but the cost of living is rising. </p>
